## Brief
For this exercise we would like you to build a small microservice that provides data on UK clinics.
Your app should provide 2 data endpoints:
- /clinics/postcode/:postcode
- /clinics/city/:name

## Dependencies

## Setup
* clone the repo
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/samjones1001/clinic-api-test
```

* navigate into the cloned directory and install dependencies
```shell
$ cd clinic-api-test
$ npm install
```

* run tests
```shell
$ npm test
```

## Usage instructions
* navigate into the cloned directory and start the app server
```shell
$ cd clinic-api-test
$ node server/app.js
```

The application provides two end points
- /clinics/partial_postcode/:partial_postcode
- /clinics/city/:city

The endpoints can be accessed through a browser or from the command line using curl.
